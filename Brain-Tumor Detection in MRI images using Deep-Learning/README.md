# Detecting Brain Tumor  in MRI images using Deep Learning
 The main purpose of this project is to build  a robust CNN model that can classify if the  subject has a tumor or not based on brain  MRI images with a good accuracy for  medical grade application.
 
The project was divided into Five stages 
namely: Data acquisition, Data pre-processing, Data augmentation, Model architecture, Training and testing the model.

For this project Iâ€™ve used the following Kaggle
dataset https://www.kaggle.com/navoneel/brainmri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection
~This dataset contains a total of 253 Brain MRI images
~155 of them are images of brain with tumour and 98 of 
them are images of normal brain.
